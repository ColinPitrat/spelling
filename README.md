# spelling
A small tool to practice spelling

The code has been shamelessly copied from https://gist.github.com/jeffgrover/8761544be4e8025f2a67b629d7f481dc and then adapted to my needs.

The lists of words `short_words`, `medium_words` and `long_words` have been extracted from https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists/English/Wikipedia_(2016).

The list of words `bee_list_words` is from the list of 2025 words from an Irish schools.
